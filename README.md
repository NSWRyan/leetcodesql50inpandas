# README
* This is just a practice for me for refreshing the basic pandas functions.
* I hope the notebook format and printed result can help someone who just started learning Python/Pandas.

# Content
1. Pandas solution.
    * Some of the contents are solutions from the top answers.
2. Spark Scala solution.
    * Not sure if it will pass all of the test cases.
    * At least the provided solutions should match the example test case.

# Note
